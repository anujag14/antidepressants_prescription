This project uses Python and Pandas to give a thorough longitudinal analysis of NHS 
England's antidepressant prescribing data. Utilizing actual prescription cost information 
from the [NHS Open Data Portal](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/), the research reveals 
regional and national patterns in prescription volume and spending over a four-year span.

Key highlights:
- Cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed prescription data using Pandas
- Built visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to show trends and cost patterns
- Identified top prescribed antidepressants and regional cost drivers
- Supported public health insight generation through exploratory data analysis

This study is perfect for anyone looking at real-world Python use cases in public 
health and demonstrates how data science can be applied practically in healthcare analytics.
